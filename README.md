# 🛳️ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is a solution for the classic Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using passenger data (such as age, gender, class, etc).

## 📌 Problem Statement
Given the passenger data, build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived.
